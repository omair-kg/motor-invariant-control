Physically Based Motion Synthesis is challenging, mainly because of Freedom Curse, which usually involves lots of computational work. 
In this paper, we develop a new method based on the biological idea of motion primitive. 
Motion Synthesis and Motion Retargeting are achieved by modifying the basic motion primitives. 
Our Method separate stability control and motion style in two decoupled problem. 
In mathematical viewport,  the method control the topology and space of flow independently.
Our method can generate adaptive motion, is applicable for a large number of system and is computational efficient.
