\section{Combination}

\subsection{Symmetry of CPG}
For a dynamic system L, we have global invarant controller  Ugc, and local Invariant Controller Ulc.
A question is how to combine them together.
Our method is combine the different controller following the same symmetry.
When a system L has a symmetry of $G_a$, $G_a$ is applied also tow $G_gl$
The Simmetry of Global Oscilator.
Neural oscillator are couple with mechanical oscillator in the following manner.
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}=F(x,u1)
\dot{x_c}=S(x_c,u2);
u1=ho*O(x_c)
u2=hi*I(x)
\end{equation}
Pose offset:
When the original $G_off$ is apply to the x,
If we keep $I(x)$ is the invariant of $G_off$, then the Symmetry of the how system will be kept.
Pose scalling group
When $G_scal$ is applied to the x, if we $hi=hi/scal$.
Then the symmetry is kept.
Time scalling
If the scale factor is ts, we keep modify modify the original equation by %$\tao=tao*ts$.
hou=hou*ts*ts.
Time offset
This involves modify the state on the limit circle.
\subsection{Motion Transition}
When an character transform from one motion into another, character should in the state space $(q,\dot{q})$
For when motion is translated from motion ma to motion mb.
The state of %$(q,\dot{q} \in Boa(ma) \union Boa(mb)$
