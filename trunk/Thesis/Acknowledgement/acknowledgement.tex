At first, I must thank Prof Zhang for introducing me the interesting world of computer animation research.
Prof Zhang is a great supervisor, who gives the st\label{•} udents freedom to pursue their own interests. 
 
I'm very grateful to Dr Xiaosong Yang, my second supervisor, besides the knowledge and advice, it must cost your and Dr Ren lots of effort to take care of every trouble during my study life in UK.
 
 I would also never forget my best friend at NCCA, Richard Southern; your critical questions greatly reshaped my thoughts.
 Without your help, so much research work may lie unproven or unnoticed.
 Even someone may find the thesis still hard to understand, it is my fault.
 My original draft is awful, by ask me hundreds of embarrassing questions, Richard taught me how should I present my work.
Richard Southern is the first and maybe the only one who fully understand my work at current.
 And your encouragement is crucial during the time of misunderstood, disappointment and loneliness.

 Also I must express my gratitude for Aunt Jie Zhang. Your support is the most valuable thing during my hardiest time.
