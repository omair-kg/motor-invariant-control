At first, I must thank Prof Zhang for introducing me the interesting world of computer animation research.
Prof Zhang is a great supervisor, who gives the students freedom to pursue their own research interest. 
 
I'm very grateful to Dr Xiaosong Yang, my second supervisor.
Besides the knowledge and advice, it must have cost your and Dr Ren lots of effort to take care of every trouble during my study in UK.
 
I would also never forget my best friend at NCCA, Richard Southern; your critical questions greatly reshaped my thoughts.
Without your help, so much research work may lie unproven or unnoticed.
Even someone may still find the thesis still hard to understand, it is all my fault.
My original draft is awful, by asking me hundreds of embarrassing questions, Richard has taught me how should I present my work.
Richard Southern is the first and maybe the only one who fully understand my work at current.
 And your encouragement is crucial during the time of misunderstood, disappointment and loneliness.

Also I must express my gratitude to  Lady Jie Zhang. 
Your support is the most valuable thing during my hardiest time.

Dr You and Ms Sue Court have taken great effort in refine the English of the thesis.
