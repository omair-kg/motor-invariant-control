For animals,  being able to maintain the global motor invariant is not enough.
For a fish, preserving \emph{Global Motor Invariant}  means the swimming can be sustained and stable.
But a fish also needs to adjust the swimming speed and swimming direction,which is of crucial importance for survival.
In real-life, animal can  motion primitive according its purpose with precision.
This chapter develops the control strategies for tweaking motion patterns according to motion purpose.

It is important to remember that such tweaking strategies are severely constrained by the computation and memory capacity of neural system,  and should resemble  motion primitive in exploring natural dynamics.
For \cms, it is of no meaning developing walking pattern by exploring natural dynamics but use optimization to adjust the walking speed. To meet such requirements, \moit adopted a combination of ideas.

At first, when tweaking motion patterns, stability should not be violated. 
As stated in the previous chapter, a topology conjugation (one-one continuous invertible mapping)maintains the topology thus maintains the qualitative stability. Thus the ``tweaking'' action should be a topology conjugation. In an alternative perspective, such operations form a group and permit a combination operation. 
For motor control, this means if two tweaking actions preserve the stability separately, combination of the two actions also preserve the stability.
The space of topology conjugation is very large, \moit only investigate a subset that is biological supported and computational efficient: \emph{The Lie Transformation Group}.
Selected groups can be divided into orthodox subgroups , each of which is continuous and can be parametrized by one parameter.
In \cms, such parameters close related to motion purpose or requirement, for example, walking speed or swimming direction.

From dynamic perspective, ``tweaking''  should also explore natural dynamics (passive based) as primitives.
Methods adopted in \moit belongs to  a popular passive-based control principle, which carries many names: Controlled Symmetry, Controlled Lagrange, or Potential Shaping.
Different names reflect the fact that this method can be developed through different ways.
Roughly speaking, the original dynamic system is transformed according to motion purpose, the kinematics is untouched and control is applied by modifying the potential energy.
Such methods suit biological actuators like muscles and are also computational efficient:
Closed form formula are developed for converting tweaking parameters to control effort.

This chapter is lay out in this way:
Section~\ref{sec:groupandsymmetry} introduces the basic idea of group and symmetry from intuitive geometry examples to more abstract algebraic formulation. Section~\ref{sec:liecontrol} investigate application of controlled Lagrange method.
At last a simple dynamic example is provided in Section~\ref{sec:symball}.

Group and Invariant are the two sides of a coin.
Group are defined by invariant.
Deciding which group should be applied to motion is equivalent finding which invariant should be persevered.
The quantitative property preserved are called \emph{Local Motor Invariant}.







\section{Group and Symmetry}
\label{sec:groupandsymmetry}
%To make motions realistic, some natural looking features should also be preserved.
%Some features of motions such as smoothness or energy efficient are quantitative.
%\cms research should provide a framework preserving feature.
%Another question mission is animals can finish motion tasks require high accuracy.
%
%These are the motivations for the development of \emph{Local Motor Invariant}.
%Local Motor Invariants are quantitative properties of motions, the idea of invariant preserving are abstracted as the ``Symmetry'' and Group theory.
%Features are modelled as symmetrical functions, while feature preserving actions form a group.
%From dynamic perspective, motions are solutions to dynamic equations.
%The actions transform one motion to another close related to the Lie Group Theory for differential equations\citep{olver1986applications}.
%
%The introduction of Lie Group not only provides a powerful mathematical tools for modelling the symmetry property, but also provides an idea to simplify the solving the dynamics.



For the more traditional geometrical perspective, ''Symmetry''  means a geometry is the same after certain transformation.
For the example, a square remains the same after  $90$ degree clockwise rotation, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:symsquare}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  	\begin{center}
   	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Symmetry}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Symmetry of The Square}
    \label{fig:symsquare}
\end{figure}

Actions that preserve the square shape have some properties.
For example, if the action of $90$ degree clockwise rotation preserves the shape, so will the action of rotating twice, that's $180$ degree clockwise rotation.

All the action that can preserve the symmetry form a group $G$.
A group has the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any $g_a,g_b$ in $G$, \,$g_a*g_b$\, belongs to $G$. (The operation ``$*$'' is closed).

\item For any \,$g_a,g_b,g_c\in G$, \,$(g_a*g_b)*g_c=g_a*(g_b*g_c)$. \,(Associativity of the operation).

\item There is an element $e\in G$ such that \,$g_a*e=e*g_a=g_a$\, for any \,$g_a\in G$. (Existence of identity element).

\item For any \,$g_a\in G$\, there exists an element $g_h$ such that \,$g_a*g_h=g_h*g_a=e$. \,(Existence of inverses).
\end{enumerate}

For the square example, all the actions preserve the same form the group $G$.
$g_1$ is  $90$ degree clockwise rotation, identity element $e$ is no rotation,
$g_2=g_1*g_1$ is rotate $90$ degree clockwise twice.
Since $g_2$ preserve symmetry, $g_2$ is a element of the group $G$, 


From algebraic perspective, ``Symmetry'' means the value of function is invariant after transformation.
For a function $I(x)$,
The group transformation is define by $\tilde{x}=g_a(x)$
By symmetry, we mean $I(x)=I(\tilde{x})$.
$I(x)$ is an invariant function of group $G$.


Note that  shapes invariant by actions in $G$ is not unique.
Many shapes are invariant, and their combinations are also invariant, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SymmetrySpace}. 
In algebraic sense,  invariant functions of group $G$ form a space, the invariant space $I^G$.


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{SymmetrySpace}
    \caption{Two invariant Shapes and the invariant combination}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lie Group and Differential Equation}
Physically-based motions are usually described by differential equations, and motion is the solution of the equation.
As the square shape, there are also symmetry groups that keep the differential equations invariant.
For differential equations, the important property is elements in such group can transform one solution into another\citep{olver1986applications}.
For \cms, this property potential can help reduce computational burden, new motions can be achieved through applying group transformation to motion primitives.




Simply put, \emph{Lie Group} is continuous group, which is also a manifold.
Since it is a manifold, coordinate system can be assigned to a Lie Group and each elements can be parametrized.
For example,the symmetry rotation group of square is discrete,while symmetry group of circle is continuous.
For the symmetry group of the circle, each element can be parametrize by the the rotation angle.
In the following discussions, for each group element $g$, $\ep$ is the parameter.

Theory of Lie group comes from the study of differential equations.
For a differential equation in Equation~\ref{eq:difforg}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:difforg}
\dot{\state}=F(\state)
\end{equation}
Invariant function $I$ can be defined as:
\[
I(t,\state,\dot{\state})=F(\state)-\dot{\state}
\]
Solutions of the differential equation are the kernel of the invariant function $I$ :
 \[
 I(t,\state,\dot{\state})=0
 \]
 
 
The group transformation will act on all the variables of invariant function, so $t$,$\state$ and $\dot{\state}$ are all transformed.
\[
(t,\state,\dot{\state}) \mapsto (\tilde{t},\tilde{\state},\dot{\tilde{\state}})
\]
If the group $G$ is symmetrical, then value of the  function $I$ will be invariant.
Thus kernel are transformed into kernel, and transformed variables are still solutions to the original differential equations. 
\[
I(t,\state,\dot{\state})=I(\tilde{t},\tilde{\state},\dot{\tilde{\state}})=0
\]


Note that the $\dot{\state}$ is not independent, it depends on the $t$ and $\state$,
\[
\dot{\tilde{\state}}=\frac{d \tilde{\state} }{d \tilde{t}}
\]
From geometrical perspective, it is not easy to present  transformation of $t$.
Instead, we define two actions on the state space and tangent space.
In the state space, we define the  action $g$ that transform the state. 
\[
g(\state)=\tilde{\state}
\]
In the tangent space, we define the \emph{lift action} $Tg$ 
\[
Tg(\dot{\state})=\dot{\tilde{\state}}
\]

$Tg$ can be worked out by formatting the derivatives in original coordinate system.
For example, the translation $g_{\ep}$ 
\[
(x,y)\mapsto (x+\ep,y+\ep)
\]
$Tg_{\ep}$ is
\[
(\dot{x},\dot{y}) \mapsto (\dot{x},\dot{y})
\]
$Tg$ is the identity element $e$.


In the general cases, $g$ transform Equation~\ref{eq:difforg} into Equation~\ref{eq:trdiff}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:trdiff}
Tg(\dot{\state})=F(g(\state))
\end{equation}
if $g$ is symmetrical, Equation~\ref{eq:difforg} and Equation~\ref{eq:trdiff} are equivalent







 	
For example, 
The scaling action is applied to the state space of the mass spring system of Equation~\ref{eq:stateform}. 
\[
\tilde{\state}=g_{\ep}(\state)=[\ep q, \ep \qd ]
\]
then the lift action is
\[
\tilde{\state}=Tg_{\ep}(\state)=[\ep \qd, \ep \ddot{q}]
\]



by substitution $\state \mapsto \tilde{\state}$, the original system become
\[ 
\dot{\tilde{\state}}=
\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
0 &1\\
-1 &0 
\end{array}
\right]\tilde{\state}
\]
which is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tranmas} 
\ep \dot{\state}=
\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
0 &1\\
-1 &0 
\end{array}
\right]\ep \state
\end{equation}

Equation ~\ref{eq:tranmas} is equivalent to  Equation~\ref{eq:stateform}.
If $\state(t)$ is a solution, so is $\tilde{\state}(t)$.

To verify the group property. define $*$ as:
\[
g_{\ep_1}*g_{\ep_2}(\state)=[\ep_1 \ep_2 q, \ep_1 \ep_2 \qd]
\]

The inverse is:
\[
g_{\ep}^{-1}=g_{\frac{1}{\ep}} \;\ep \in R^+
\]

\begin{mydef}
For a group $G$, the invariant function of state $I(\state)$ is called \emph{local motion invariant} of $G$. 
\end{mydef}

Invariant functions $I(\state)$ has important  meaning in dynamics. 
According  \textbf{Noether's Theorem}, each $I(\state)$ corresponds to a conservative law. 


\section{Lie Group and Controlled Lagrange}
\label{sec:liecontrol}
It is not enough for animals  only to  explore symmetry groups of natural dynamics for motion adaptation.
For a dynamic system, the symmetry group is quite restricted and  working out the symmetry group might be a non-trivial task.
In real-life, animal usually exert control effort during motion adaptations.

\moit theory propose the idea that control effort can make an non symmetrical group become symmetrical, and introduce the \emph{Control Lagrange} method.
Based on biological research\citep{flash2007affine}, some simple group are selected the symmetry group for motor control,
control efforts are applied to ensure the symmetry.


Usually a dynamic system are presented as by Euler-Lagrange Equation~\ref{eq:uncontrolled_euler_lagrange}\citep{Goldstein2002}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \qd} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0
\label{eq:uncontrolled_euler_lagrange}
\end{equation}

Where $L=K-V$, $L$ is the Lagrange, $K$ is the kinetic energy, $V$ is the potential energy, $q$ is the generalized coordinates, and $\qd$ is the generalized velocity.

By applying the group transformation $g$, both the generalized coordinates and generalized velocity will be changed:
\[
g(\state)=\tilde{\state}=[\tilde{q}, \dot{\tilde{q}}]
\]
The Euler-Lagrange equation for the transformed dynamic system is Equation~\ref{eq:liegroup_euler_lagrange}.
If control is applied, the Euler-Lagrange equation of the controlled dynamics is Equation~\ref{eq:controlled_euler_lagrange}. 
If symmetry is persevered, the two equation should be equivalent.
then symmetry control input $\ulocal$ can be calculated by comparing the two equations.
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\tilde{q}}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \tilde{q} }&=0,\label{eq:liegroup_euler_lagrange}\\
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \qd} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}&=\ulocal. \label{eq:controlled_euler_lagrange}
\end{align}

When the two equations are the equivalent, their Lagrange $L$, Kinetic Energy $K$ and potential energy $V$, should be the same or of the same scale factor.
Thus in theory, two strategies exist and will result in two different $\ulocal$:
We can calibrate the kinetic by scaling and apply control effort to compensate the difference in potential energy, or calibrate potential energy and compensate the kinetic energy.
\moit adopt the potential shaping strategy, for it is computational efficient and suitable for muscle like biological actuators.
Further restrict the group to homogeneous group or affine group promise a close form formulation.
Several groups and their potential shaping control effort are as below:



\subsection*{ Offset Action}
Offset actions  modify the generalized coordinate $q$ by a constant, while speed and time remain unchanged.
Given the offset parameter $\ep$, the mapping will be in the following form:
\[
(t,q,\qd) \mapsto (t,q+\ep,\qd)
\]

The corresponding state transformation and lift action are
\begin{align}
\goff(\state) &= [q+\ep,\qd] \\
T\goff(\dot{\state})&=\dot{\state}=[\qd,\qdd]
\end{align}


On phase space,  $q$ is usually represented the horizontal axis, and $\dot{q}$ is represented by the vertical axis.
From the geometrical perspective, offset actions will move the phase portrait horizontally~\ref{fig:goff}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{g_off}
    \caption{Offset Action}
    \label{fig:goff}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Substituted the transformed $q$ and $\qd$ into Equation~\ref{eq:liegroup_euler_lagrange} and Equation~\ref{eq:controlled_euler_lagrange}.
The control input is can be worked out in the following close form formula:
\begin{equation}
\ulocal(q) = \frac{\partial}{\partial q} \left(V(q)-V(\tilde{q}) \right).
\end{equation}

As an example, for the mass spring system of Equation~\ref{eq:mass-spring},the transformed equation  and control equation are as follows.
\begin{align}
\ddot{\tilde{q}}+\tilde{q}-\ep&=0 \nonumber \\
\ddot{q}+q&=\ulocal \nonumber
\end{align}
By comparing the two equations, we work out that:
\[
\ulocal(q)=\ep
\]




\subsection*{Time Scaling}

%g_st(q,dot{q})=(q,st*dot{q})
Time scaling actions divide by the time variable by a factor $\ep$, the generalized coordinates are kept unchanged, the generalized speed will be multiplied by $ep$.
For the action of parameter $\ep$, the action mapping is: 


\[
(t,q,\qd) \mapsto (\frac{t}{\ep},q,\ep \qd)
\]

The corresponding state transformation and lift action are
\begin{align}
\gts(\state)&=[q,\ep \qd] \nonumber \\
T\gts(\dot{\state})&=[\ep \qd,\ep^2 \ddot{q}]\nonumber
\end{align}

From geometrical perspective, time scaling will stretch the phase portrait vertically,as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gts}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{g_ts}
	 \caption{Time Scaling Action}
    \label{fig:gts}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The control input can be worked out in the same manner as offset actions.
The control input is of the following closed form formula.
\begin{equation}
\ulocal(q) = (1-\ep^2) \frac{\partial V(q)}{\partial q}.
\end{equation}

Again, the mass spring system of Equation \ref{eq:mass-spring} is selected as an example, transformed and controlled equations are

\begin{align}
\frac{\ddot{\tilde{q}}}{\ep^2}+\tilde{q}&=0 \nonumber \\
\ddot{q}+q&=\ulocal \nonumber
\end{align}
The local control input is:
\[
\ulocal=(1-\ep^2)q
\]




\subsection*{Energy Scaling}
For dynamic system of the conservative field,
the energy is preserved in motion and different motions are characterized by their energy.
For such system, motion can be adapted by modifying the energy of the dynamic system.

Energy Scaling action is introduced to adapt motion by scaling the energy.
the transformation has the following property:
\[
E(\tilde{\state})=\ep^2 E(\state)
\]
 where$E$ is the energy, defined as $E(\state)=K+V$,  $K$ is the kinetic energy,
$V$ is the potential energy.

Further suppose that both the potential and kinetic energy are transformed uniformly.
\begin{align}
K(\tilde{\state})=\ep^2 K(\state) \nonumber\\
V(\tilde{\state})=\ep^2 V(\state) \nonumber
\end{align}
When mass inertia matrix is constant, energy scaling transformation is linear as follows:
\[
(t,q,\qd ) \mapsto ( \frac{f(\ep)}{\ep}t ,f(\ep)q,\ep\qd)
\]
$f(\ep)$ is a function of $\ep$, which is determined by the conservative field.
Geometrically, energy scaling action enlarge the phase portrait,as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gen}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{g_en}
    \caption{Energe Scaling Action}
    \label{fig:gen}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The corresponding  state transformation and lift action are:
\begin{align}
\gen(\state)&=(f(\ep) q,\ep \dot{q}) \nonumber\\
T\gen(\dot{\state})&=(\ep \dot{q},\frac{\ep^2}{f(\ep)}\qdd)
\end{align}

$\ulocal$ can by worked out in the same manner as actions above.
Rather than write down the close form formula, the thesis prefers an alternative process.
Energy Scaling can be seen as a composed action of two actions: scaling the generalized coordinates and scaling the time variable.
Separate formula can be developed for two actions independently.
This principles generates modular code structure.




The mass spring system of Equation\ref{eq:mass-spring} is selected again as an example.
 For the mass spring system, Energy is defined as~$E=\frac{1}{2}(q^2+\qd^2)$.
 If the energy is scaled up by $\ep^2$,  potential energy are scaled up by $\ep^2$.
 Because $V= \frac{1}{2}q^2$, and $\ep^2 V=\frac{1}{2}(f(\ep)q)^2$, thus $f(\ep)=\ep$.
 
 
The control input can be worked out in the same manner as above actions, but usually, when object moved in the conservative field, energy scaling is an symmetry group of original dynamic system, thus no control effort is needed.
\[
\ulocal=0
\]



\subsection*{Time Offset}

Time offset actions modify the time  variable $t$ by the parameter~$\ep$, the map is as follows
\[
(t,q,\qd) \mapsto (t+\ep,q,\qd)
\]


For a system oscillating with limit cycle, time offset action will modify the phase, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gtoff}.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{g_toff}
    \caption{Offset Action}
    \label{fig:gtoff}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For dynamic system, time offset is symmetrical for all dynamic system.
At first look, no control effort is needed.
In practise, time offset is achieved by applying time scaling twice, after applying time scaling $\ep$ for sometime,and then apply the inverse action(time scaling of $\frac{1}{\ep}$) for sometime.


\subsection{Action Selection}
There are many actions available for motion adaptation.
In certain situations, there are many different ways to satisfy the motion constraints, then the problem of which action to apply arise.
Different group will result in different motion style, Chapter~\ref{chap:walk} support this idea with lots of examples.
In practise, this is left for the animator to decide.
Usually, the symmetry of natural dynamic is preferred, for such actions are energy efficient.







\section{Example: Symmetry of The Bouncing Ball System}
\label{sec:symball}
Symmetry is a common property among many dynamic system, even for hybrid systems like the bouncing ball system of Equation~\ref{eq:bbeq}.
It is shown in this section that by utilizing the symmetry group, complex motions can be predicted in an computational efficient way.

The bouncing ball system of~\ref{eq:bbeq} has a energy scaling symmetry.

The energy function of the bouncing ball system is  
\[
E=\mathrm{g}q+\frac{1}{2}m\qd^2
\]
If the energy is scaled up by $\ep^2$,  potential energy are scaled up by $\ep^2$.
 Because $V= \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{g}q$, and $\ep^2 V=\frac{1}{2}f(\ep)q$, thus:
\[
f(\ep)=\ep^2
\]
the energy scaling transformation is
\[
\gen(\state)=[\ep^2 q, \ep \qd]
\]

For the bouncing ball system, the energy of a system can be characterized by the initial dropping height.

Given the motion of a ball dropt at $5$,shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bouncing5},set $\ep=\sqrt{2}$, through transformation, motion dropped from $10$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bouncing10}
