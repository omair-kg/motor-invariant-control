\subsection{Bipedal Walking}
\subsubsection{Dynamic Model}
iure 1 shows the a two dimensional walking model.
Like bouncing ball, this system is also an hybrid system.
The motion include four phases.
1 in free swing phase.
Mddq/dt+Cdq+N=0
2 the knee strike phase
Qq=Qq
3 the knee lock phase
Mddq/dt+Cdq+N=0
4 the keel strike phase.
Qq=Qq
this system can do passive walking
under specific initial position, the walker can walk passively downstairs.
And exhibit a limit circle.

\subsubsection{Global Invarian Control}
just like mass spring system, the basic idea of control is using the entrainment oscillator to 
motion adaptation. 
The input of the nerual oscillator is the angle between the two legs.
The output of the nerual oscillator is acting on the hip joint
\[
g_in=h*(q1-q2)
yout=hout*neural.
\]
the period is double and the step is not symmetrical any more. So the two legs move in a slight different manner, but still, it keeps walking.

\subsubsection{Local Invariant Control}
lie group symmetry provide method for adapting the walking motion for different terrain and for at different speed.


Slope Change.
N=N*g.
u=N(g*cos(theta)-g)
Speed Change
u=Ng*(speed*speed-1)

4 Walking on any slope with any speed with any walking style
when Combined together, our system can walking on different terrian with any speed and any style.
