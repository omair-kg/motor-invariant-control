Further Work and Discussion
Motion Synthesis greatly reduced the computational load and generate adaptative motion.
But since it is new and not sophisticated.
Further research is needed.
\subsection{ Modeling More Behaviour}
This method is applicable for lots of system.
But this method greatly relies on the dynamic properties of body environment.
The method is not sensitive for small error, so, local modelling error maybe accepts, but the qualitative property must kept.
This is not a trivial task.
 Some of the key features especially the qualitative dynamic property we are just begin to known.
Further application, fluid dynamic of fish and squid swimming.
\subsection{ More Complex Systems and More Type of Symmetry}
For develop lagrange, symbolic expression need to be provide, for high degree system, this may becomes problematic.
Local frame based Method
\subsection{Data Driven}
Can we find symmetry info from data rather than symbolic differential equation?
\subsection{Symmetry and Boid System}
can symmetry be applied to boid system?
