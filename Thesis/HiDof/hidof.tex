\section{Introduction}
A question arised that whether motor invariant theory is extensible for system with high degrees of freedom.
For walk and stance, motions of the torso and arm need to be incoporated.
Also for the snakes and fishes, synthesise motion for the veterbarea of the fllexible body is a big challenge.
 



Redudant \dof is the key challenging in motion synthesis.
In motor invariant theory, redundant \dof s don't increase the computational burnden expontentially.
This is achieved through utilizing the passive effects in dynamics.

For the passive walker, all the dofs are uncontrolled,increased \dof s will not increase controlelr burden.
The computational burden of neural oscillator remains constant during increase of \dof s in dynamic model.
The computational burden for controlled symmetry is trival and increased lineary with the number of \dof s, as long as the symbolic equations of dynamics is given.

For motor invariant theory, the difficulties in high dimention comes from  the obtaining the symbolic dynamic equations.
This chapter focus on methods that avoid the difficulties of developing high \dof symbolic equations.
To this end, different strategies are different in different situations.
\begin{itemize}

\HiItem{Neglectable \dof }
Some \dof s can be simply neglected.
neglectable \dof s come from two reason:
The motion of some \dof are is very limited or it has the same effect as lie group action, it thus will not affect the qualitative properties.
Such \dof s can be totally neglected and low dimential dynamic equation are used for controllelr.

\HiItem{Mechanical Coupling}
Instead of simulating and developing controllers for a complex mechanical system, we can decouple the complex system into many conponents by the divide and conquer strategy.

For some high \dof system can be seens as composed of many low dof conponents.
Controllers are only designed on each component.
\HiItem{Time Offset}
For fish or snake, their veberate is made up of a huge number of similar joints.
It is impossible to neglected some \dof s or decouple the dynamics into components.


\end{itemize} 

\section{Neglation and Reduction}
\subsection{Neglatable}
Although biological mechanical structure is of high degree of freedom, many \dof s will have not affect the topology or qualitative properties.

For the walking example,\citet{Raibert1986} point out walking is the same as a ball rolling down a slope while running is ball bounding down a slope.
In our research, control strategy are developed based on the compass gait model, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compassgait}.
The degree of knees~\ref{fig:passivekneewalker} and foot~\ref{{fig:arcfoot}} will have little effects on the qualitative properties.
Although the compass gait and arc foot model are different from the model of our simulation, the three model are all capable of passive walking and shows limit cycles of similar shapes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compassgaitlimitcycle} and Figure~\ref{fig:arcfootlimitcycle}.


This idea may be understand through the perturbation or averaging theory.
For some degree of freedom, it the motion of \dof is relatively small, motion of such \dof can be totally negalected.
From this persective, we can treat such \dof as structual perturbation, for the kneed example, the relativeliy small moton of knee is equalavent to perturbation of the leg length and the mass position.

    \label{fig:arcfootlimitcycle}
\end{center}
\end{figure}





Following this idea, we add foot to the original walker.
When foot is added, we only have to modify the collition model of the heel strike.
From experience, foot will boost the stability.
Our hypothesis is that adding the foot will prolong the double stance time.
We model the double foot stance has the effect of pushing the stance state toward the limit cycle.
This is model by a liner model.
\begin{equation}
\dot{q}_st=(1-r)\dot{q}_st+r\dot{q}^{desir}_st
\end{equation}



The gait is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ToeGait}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

%And all the four system, can apply the same kind of symmetry group.

%\end{center}
%\end{figure}


%Following this idea, although not implemented in this research, more dofs like foot may also possible.
%But that's just an extra level of complexity, without modifying the principles. 
\subsection{Symmetry Reduction}
For some \dof s, their dynamics are not neglactable, but they will affect the dynamics in an unified manner.
The effects of such \dof can be neglected when the system is controlled under controlled symmetry.

This idea can help us to extend the 2D walker into 3D dimention.
Rather than develop the full 3D dynamcis, the effects of the motion in Coronal Plane and transverse plane can be modelled as transformation of the dynamics on spaghittal plane.


This can be analyzed by showing the sway angle in the coronal plane, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sidesway}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Sidesway}
    \caption{Sideway}
    \label{fig:sidesway}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

When the walker have a sway angle $\alpha$, the gravity force on the sagittal phase are lowes thus the external force $N$ becomes $N'=cos(\alpha)N$
This has the same effect as applying speed action which the parameter $\ep, where \ep^2-1=\cos(\alpha)$.
The effects of sway can be simulated by adjust the speed action parameters$\ep$.
For walker with speed action control capacity, the effects of this \dof can be totally reduced.


Also the dynamic model is free of the rotation on the transverse plane.
If the ground is rotating around the tranverse plane at constant speed, then only the centrifigual force is generated perpendiculator to the sagittal plane, this force is easilly componsated by the friction on the foot.

For the walker make a turning, the spahittal plane is rotate in an constant speed, this can be achievied by actuating the yaw joint of the suppoting leg, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:turn}.
The gait is shown in ~\ref{fig:walkturn}

\section{Mechanical Coupling}
Some mechanical system can be treated as connecting many different simple components together.
the different parts of motion formed mechanical entrainment.
if a mechanical system is model like
\[
\dot{\state}=F(\state)
\]
the state is $\state=[q_1,q_2,\qd_1,\qd_2]$
we can reform the the dynamic equation in the manner
$\state=[\state_1,\state_2]$
where
$\state_1=[q_1,\qd_1]$
$\state_2=[q_2,\qd_2]$

and  the original dynamic equation can be formulated as
\begin{align}
\dot{\state}_1&=F_1(\state_1)+C_1(\state_1,\state_2)\nonumber\\
\dot{\state}_2&=F_2(\state_2)+C_2(\state_1,\state_2),\nonumber
\end{align}

if $C_{1,2} \ll F_{1,2}$, then the dynamic will be dominated by $F_{1,2}$ and $C_{1,2}$ can be treated as perturbation.
Controller can be designed according to $F_{1,2}$

\subsection*{Branches Mechanical Structure}
In fact any mechanical system can be reformulated as entrainment netwok,
a proper method should separate different components when the coupling is weak.
the weak couple joint can be found through the mechanical structure.

when have mechanical structure in figure

\end{figure}

original dynamic system should be of 5 DOF and develop the full dynamic system should be of 5 by 5 matrix.
in the following form


\[

\]

where

\]





while for the braches structure in Figure \ref{fig:branches structure}.
there the efficient between different branches $4,5$ and $2,3$ will be zero.

where
\[
M=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & m_{14} & m_{15}\\
m_{12} & m_{22} & m_{23} & 0 & 0\\

\]

and

\]








They happens when they the mechanical have a branch structure.
when mechanical have a branch structure,
the dynamic equation will be in the following manner.
where
\[
M=\left[\begin{array}{ccc|cc}
m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} & m_{14} & m_{15}\\
m_{12} & m_{22} & m_{23} & 0 & 0\\
m_{13} & m_{23} & m_{33} & 0 & 0\\ \hline
m_{14} & 0 & 0 & m_{44} & m_{45}\\
m_{15} & 0 & 0 & m_{45} & m_{55}\end{array}\right]
=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
M_{33} & M_{c32}\\
M_{c32} & M_{22}\end{array}\right]
\]

and
\[
C=
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|cc}
0 & C_{12}\dot{q_{2}} & C_{13}\dot{q}_{3} & C_{14}\dot{q}_{4} & C_{15}\dot{q}_{5}\\
-C_{12}\dot{q_{1}} & 0 & C_{23}\dot{q}_{3} & 0 & 0\\
-C_{13}\dot{q_{1}} & -C_{23}\dot{q}_{2} & 0 & 0 & 0\\ \hline
-C_{14}\dot{q_{1}} & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{45}\dot{q}_{5}\\
-C_{15}\dot{q_{1}} & 0 & 0 & -C_{45}\dot{q}_{4} & 0\end{array}\right]
=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
c_{33} & c_{c32}\\
c_{c32} & c_{22}\end{array}\right]
\]
based on where the mechanical branches, we can separate the dynamic equation into two parts,
and simulate them independently and form the mechanical entrainment network.


\[
M_{33}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\ddot{q}_{1}\\
\ddot{q}_{2}\\
\ddot{q}_{3}\end{array}\right]+C_{33}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{q}_{1}\\
\dot{q}_{2}\\
\dot{q}_{3}\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
N_{1}(q_{1})\\
N_{2}(q_{2})\\
N_{3}(q_{3})\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_{1}\\
u_{2}\\
u_{3}\end{array}\right]-\left[\begin{array}{c}
m_{14}\ddot{q}_{4}+m_{15}\ddot{q}_{5}\\
0\\
0\end{array}\right]-\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{14}\dot{q}_{4}^{2}+c_{15}\dot{q}_{5}^{2}\\
0\\
0\end{array}\right]
\]

\[
M_{22}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\ddot{q}_{4}\\
\ddot{q}_{5}\end{array}\right]+C_{22}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{q}_{4}\\
\dot{q}_{5}\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
N_{4}(q_{4})\\
N_{5}(q_{5})\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_{1}\\
u_{2}\end{array}\right]-\left[\begin{array}{c}
m_{14}\\
m_{15}\end{array}\right]\ddot{q}_{1}-\left[\begin{array}{c}
-c_{14}\\
-c_{15}\end{array}\right]\dot{q}_{1}^{2}
\]

according the mechanical structure, this is equivalent to simulate two part of the mechanical structure independently and perturbation are treated as coupling effects.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{multilinkCoupled}
    \caption{mechanical coupling}
    \label{fig:mechcouple}
\end{center}
\end{figure}








\subsection{Torsol And Arm}
using this mechanical coupling method, we can incorporate the arm and torso motion is our dynamic system.
for the torso, the angle is $q_{tor}$,with mass $m_{tor}$ and the distance from the hip is $l_{tor}$
then we can add the torso motion to the knee walker, then the walking motion of the lower body becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:walkcouplewithtorso}
M\ddot{q}+C\dot{q}+N=u-\left[\begin{array}{c}
m_{tor}l_{tor}Lcos(q_{1}-q_{tor})\ddot{q}_{tor}\\
0\\
0\end{array}\right]-\left[\begin{array}{c}
m_{tor}l_{tor}Lsin(q_{1}-q_{tor})\dot{q}_{tor}^{2}\\
0\\
0\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

by analyzing the equation, if the torque posture kept still, it will have no effects on the lower body walking.
In real life walking, the upper body usually keep straight upward, the coupling input from the upper body is very small.



the torso motion is an inverted pendulum plus some perturbation from the lower body.
\[
m_{tor}l_{tor}^{2}\ddot{q}_{tor}=gm_{tor}l_{tor}sin(q_{tor})-(m_{tor}l_{tor}Lcos(q_{1}-q_{tor})\ddot{q}_{1}-m_{tor}l_{tor}Lsin(q_{1}-q_{tor})\dot{q}_{1}^{2})
\]
by analyzing the torso motion equation, torso motion is unstable in nature, there must be some control applied to maintain its posture.

We are not clear what the kind of controller is applied for maintain the torso posture.
The control method adopted by this research is by shaping the potential energy.
Although inverted pendulum is not stable, pendumlum is stable.
Torque is applied to make the torso work like pendulum.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{torsoAndLeg}
    \caption{The Mechanical Entrainment of Leg And Torso}
    \label{fig:torsolegentrainment}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



Simple PD controller will work well, but it does not necessary generating believable motion.
An upper body motion is close related to motion purpose and not determined by natural dynamic properties.For application purpose, maybe it is unnecessary to find a controller for upper body motion.
We can use procedure or other ``IK'' method to generate upper body motion, and add the dynamic effects to the lower body walking motion.
The motion of arm can be incorporated by following the same principles, it is just another level of complexity.


\section{Time Shift}

For some sepere and fish, the mechanical system is in chain and involves lots of similar joints.
such system dof can't be neglected or reduced through symmetry and through mechanical coupling.

For these kind of mechanical structures, an adhoc method is proposed.
The hypothesis is for each joint, since the dynamics is similar.
Thus the same control strategy is applied for every joint.
joint are differentiate by the group action.
This method potentially have two application.


The first idea is applying this method for the boid system.
Original boid system is ruled based, but method don't promise stability.
While we using group theory for simulation bold system, if all the agent using the same neural oscillator, they will converge to the same limit circle,
The uniformity of final motion of agent is grantified.
The different in the agent of modelled by lie group symmetry, different group action is applied to different agents, behavior will change accordingly.
For such application, a important group action is the Time Shift.



The fish example in Figure~\ref{fig:fishplot} has $8$ joint,  which are controlled by the \cpg s with the same parameters but  different initial condition.
They will result in the same limit cycle but maintain the phase difference.


we expend this boid example to model the fish swimming.
The fish is made up 8 links, and each dof is controlled by a neural oscillator.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fish_plot}
    \caption{CPG for Fish}
    \label{fig:fishplot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}




Simplified dynamic model are use.
each joint is modelled as a spring system.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fishdynamics}
\ddot{q}=Kq
\end{equation}

The swimming speed is proposinal to the square of the viborating velocity.
All the group action can be used.
Offset Action will result the fish turnning,
Speed Action will make the fish swim more fast.
Energy Action will modify the swimming intensity.


Figure~\ref{fig:fishswimming} and Figure~\ref{fig:fishswimline} shows the swimming gaits in a line.
Figure~\ref{fig:fishswimturn} shwo the the turning gait.
