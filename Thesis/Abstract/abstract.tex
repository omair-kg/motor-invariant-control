Generating natural-looking motions for virtual characters is a challenging research topic.
It becomes even harder when generating adaptive motions interacting with the environment. 
Current methods are tedious, cost long computational time and fail to capture natural looking features.

This report proposes an efficient method of generating natural-looking motion based upon a new motor control theory.
The principal idea is motor repertoire is made up of a limited number of elements. Motor control basically connect the basic motion primitives together just like connecting alphabets into sentences.

we propose principle of motor control is not feedbackbased, they should by model as topology conjugacy.
During motion adaptation, neural system tweaking the basic mechanical system to form a analogous dynamic system that meet constraints and purpose.

When animals adapt their motion, some properties are maintained, which are  called motor invariant.
Motion Primitives are identified by the qualitative properties, for which we use the mathematical tools of differential topology.
Tweaking of the motion primitives is model as Symmetry Preserved Transformation, for which we use lie group theory.



Following our idea, we generate adaptive natural looking motion with very little computational costs.
